# Firebase-Train-Demo

This project connects user input to the Firebase server to store a list of trains and information
relating to the time and frequency of each train entered. 

This project uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript, jQuery, moment.js, and Firebase to 
accumulate, store, and append the information.
